Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.7

   If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
   https://github.com/wso2-extensions/esb-integration-base

Tested Platform: 

 - Microsoft WINDOWS V-7
 - UBUNTU 16.04

 1. Make sure the ESB 5.0.0-BETA zip file available at "{SMPP_HOME}/repository/"

 2. Before start the ESB, download jsmpp-2.1.0-RELEASE.jar copy inside the {ESB_HOME}/repository/components/dropins

 6. Start SMSC Simulator by executing the following command, "java -cp smpp.jar:smscsim.jar com.logica.smscsim.Simulator".

                Enter 1 for the prompt to start simulation.
                Enter port number as you provided in the SMPP.properties.
